    <string name="blues_def">The blues originated with African-American communities, primarily in the
        Deep South of the United States, towards the end of the nineteenth century. It grew out of
        Spirituals, Work Songs, shouts, chants and narrative ballads. It became associated with a
        form of music using a 12 bar chord progression (although it was always much more varied than
        just this form) and employing distinctive “blue notes”, slightly at odds with notation
        Western Classical Music.
        \n\nIn the first half of the 20th century there was cross-fertilization
        with Jazz and Rhythm &amp; Blues. Blues music continued to develop into a number of
        sub-genres, including Delta Blues, Piedmont, Jump-Blues and Chicago Blues. After World War II
        many artists, particularly in Chicago, moved to amplified Electric Blues, which was a major
        influence on Rock &amp; Roll and later Blues Rock musicians and through them on Hard Rock
        and Heavy Metal music. Since then it has enjoyed a number of revivals, most recently in the
        2000s, when it was picked up by bands of the Garage Rock Revival.
